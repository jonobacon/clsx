# CLSx Project

The [Community Leadership Summit]() is the primary annual event that brings together community managers, leaders, and others to share and learn methodologies, approaches, technologies, and other elements of building strong and inclusive communities.

While there is a primary annual event, we also encourage regional events called **CLSx*. These events take the same spirit and format of the main Community Leadership Summit, but bring it to a regional location.

Anyone is welcome to run a CLSx event, but a license is required. See `clsx-license.md` in this repo for more details.

This repo contains the CLSx, materials, and other things that relate to the operation of the CLSx project.
